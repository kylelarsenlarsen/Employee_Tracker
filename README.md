# Employee Tracker

Open terminal, <br />
install dependencies with 'npm i', <br />

### `node server.js`

You will then be prompted with a list of options ranging from viewing to creating an employee database including departments, roles, and employees.

**Note: once you exit the program you will have to press 'ctrl+c' in order to escape inquirer.**
